### LITA_-Sales-Data-Project

### Sales Performance Analysis 
---
This is a project that shows my ability to query data from Lita Capstone DataSet using Excel, SQL and thereafte using PowerBI to import, analyse and visualize.

### Introduction 
---
This is an analysis of the Sales performaance of LITA Capstone DataSet. It is done by analyzing data from different schemas on the LITA Capstone DataSet. I analyzed data from LITA SalesData table, which comprises of OrderID, Customer Id,  Product, Region, OrderDate, Quantity, UnitPrice and Total Sales. I used SQL to query the data from the database and imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was carried out.

### Problem Statement
---
- The goal of this analysis is to analyse the sales performance of a retail Store. 
- Determine the demand for products and how it varies by region
- Know the current sales performance and how it compares to past performance 
- identify the areas where sales performance is lacking or could be improved.
- To discover products that have the greatest impact on sales success.
- Finally, the goal is to create data-driven plans that can aid in increasing sales, improving customer satisfaction, and driving corporate growth.

### Skills and Concepts demonstrated
---
 Excel Concept like:  
- Using Excel metrics to calculate Total Sales by Product 
   = UnitPrice * Quantity = Total Sales
  
- Using Pivot table to summarize:
- Total Sales by Product
- Total Sales by Region
- Average Sales Per Product
- Total Sales by Month
- Top 5 Product by Revenue
- Total Sales by Quantity
- Worst Selling Product by Revenue
- Worst Selling Product by Region

### SQL Concept like:
---
- Saving an Excel file as a comma delimited file.
- Loading a CSV Flat file from Excel to SQL through task bar

### Data Source
---
The data used for this analysis is gotten from the LITA Capstone Sales Data. I studied the schema and objects related to the schema.

### Data Transformation
---
This table was imported to SQL to write queries to extract  the following key insights:
   - retrieve the total sales for each product category.
   - find the number of sales transactions in each region.
   - find the highest-selling product by total sales value.
   - calculate total revenue per product.
   - calculate monthly sales totals for the current year.
   - find the top 5 customers by total purchase amount.
   - calculate the percentage of total sales contributed by each region.oidentify products with no sales in the last quarter.
     
### The queries i wrote on SQL and tables are compiled and also uploaded here as follows:

### Power BI Concepts like:
---
# Transforming and cleaning raw data
I tranformed the data in Power Query, checked for: 
- Column quality, 
- Column profile
- Column distributor
- Appropriate data types.

 # Data Analysis and Visualization

Several expressions and functions were made to arrive at the desired KPI
