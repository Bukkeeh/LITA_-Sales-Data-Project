### LITA_-Sales-Data-Project

### Sales Performance Analysis 
This is a project that shows my ability to query data from Lita Capstone Database using Excel, SQL and thereafte using PowerBI to import, analyse and visualize.

### Introduction 
This is an analysis of the Sales performaance LITA Capstone DataSet. It is done by analyzing data from different schemas on the LITA Capstone DataSet. I anlyzed data from LITA SalesData table, which comprises of OrderID, Customer Id,  Product, Region, OrderDate, Quatity, UnitPrice, and Total Sales. I used SQL to query the data from the database and imported into PowerBI where the actual analysis was carried out.

### Problem Statement
- The goal of this analysis is to analyse the sales performance of a retail Store. 
- Determine the demand for products and how it varies by region
- Know the current sales performance and how it compares to past performance 
- identify the areas where sales performance is lacking or could be improved.
- To discover products that have the greatest impact on sales success.
- Finally, the goal is to create data-driven plans that can aid in increasing sales, improving customer happiness, and driving corporate growth.
- Skills and Concepts demonstrated:

### Excel Concept like:  
- Using Excel metrics to calculate Total Sales by Product.
   = UnitPrice * Quantity = Total Sales
  
- Using Pivot table to summarize:
- Total Sales by Product
- Total Sales by Region
- Average Sales Per Product
- Total Sales by Month
- Top 5 Product by Revenue
- Total Sales by Quantity
- Worst Selling Product by Revenue
- Worst Selling Product by Region

### SQL Concept like:
- Saving an Excel file as a comma delimited file.
- Loading a CSV Flat file from Excel to SQL through task 
In SQL a Database was created to load the flatfile from excel 
The file was saved as a comma delimited file, there by loaded through task 

PowerBI concepts like:

creating columns for calculations for dates, time, and duration
Creating key performance indicators (KPIs) and other business calculations,
Developing general DAX calculations that deal with text and numbers,
Performed advanced DAX calculations for solving statistical measures and other mathematical formulas
Data Modelling,
Measures,
filters,
tooltips,
Page buttons,
Data Visualization
Data Source:

The data used for this work is gotten from the AdventureWorks 2019 database 2019. I studied the Schema, Objects related to the Schema, data dictionary and found the right tables for the analysis.
